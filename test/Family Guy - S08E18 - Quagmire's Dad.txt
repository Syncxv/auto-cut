1
00:00:01:11 --> 00:00:04:13
* It seems today
that all you see *

2
00:00:04:15 --> 00:00:07:23
* Is violence in movies
and sex on TV *

3
00:00:08:01 --> 00:00:11:08
* But where are those
good old-fashioned values *

4
00:00:11:10 --> 00:00:14:09
* On which we used to rely? *

5
00:00:14:11 --> 00:00:17:16
* Lucky there's a family guy *

6
00:00:17:17 --> 00:00:21:09
* Lucky there's a man
who positively can do *

7
00:00:21:11 --> 00:00:23:01
* All the things that make us *

8
00:00:23:03 --> 00:00:24:17
* Laugh and cry *

9
00:00:24:19 --> 00:00:30:02
* He's... a...
Fam... ily... Guy! *

10
00:00:34:20 --> 00:00:36:04
Okay, I'm off.

11
00:00:36:06 --> 00:00:37:21
Well, we knew
this day would come.

12
00:00:37:22 --> 00:00:39:15
Good luck wherever
you wind up.

13
00:00:39:16 --> 00:00:41:04
Take care, buddy.
Call if you want.

14
00:00:41:06 --> 00:00:42:18
If not, take care
of yourself.

15
00:00:42:19 --> 00:00:44:23
I'm just going away
for a few days.

16
00:00:45:00 --> 00:00:47:06
Oh.
Oh, okay.

17
00:00:47:08 --> 00:00:49:04
Yeah, there's a seminar
on creating...

18
00:00:49:05 --> 00:00:51:04
Really? It would be that easy
for you?

19
00:00:51:06 --> 00:00:52:21
What?
You thought I was
leaving forever

20
00:00:52:23 --> 00:00:54:05
and you just said,
"Good luck"?

21
00:00:54:06 --> 00:00:55:14
What the hell
was that?

22
00:00:55:16 --> 00:00:57:10
Brian, take it easy.
You're not leaving forever.

23
00:00:57:12 --> 00:00:59:11
You're just leaving
for a few days.

24
00:00:59:13 --> 00:01:01:09
What do you want,
a parade?
You know what?
Never mind.

25
00:01:01:11 --> 00:01:03:09
Look, Brian,
face it, you're a dog.

26
00:01:03:10 --> 00:01:05:18
The fact that your last name
is Griffin is a pleasantry

27
00:01:05:19 --> 00:01:08:13
extended from our family,
not by any legality.

28
00:01:08:14 --> 00:01:10:09
Yeah, and someday,
when you're ready,

29
00:01:10:11 --> 00:01:11:22
you're gonna walk off
into the woods and die.

30
00:01:11:23 --> 00:01:13:16
And we're prepared
for that.

31
00:01:14:23 --> 00:01:16:16
Yeah, so there's this seminar

32
00:01:16:18 --> 00:01:18:11
in New Haven on creating your
own Web-based Internet series.

33
00:01:18:12 --> 00:01:20:11
Sounds like it could be
right up my alley.

34
00:01:20:12 --> 00:01:22:12
Is this another one
of those classes

35
00:01:22:14 --> 00:01:24:20
where you make the checks out
directly to the teacher's name?

36
00:01:24:22 --> 00:01:26:13
Feel good about that?

37
00:01:26:15 --> 00:01:28:15
Feel good
about what you just said?

38
00:01:28:17 --> 00:01:29:21
You gonna go, Brian,

39
00:01:29:23 --> 00:01:31:18
or should I get
the can of pennies?

40
00:01:31:20 --> 00:01:34:11
(pennies rattle, Brian gasping)

41
00:01:39:22 --> 00:01:41:12
Guys, I got
some great news!

42
00:01:41:14 --> 00:01:42:23
My dad's coming
to visit.

43
00:01:43:01 --> 00:01:44:17
Oh-ho!
Hide the women!

44
00:01:44:19 --> 00:01:46:19
So, we're finally
gonna get to meet

45
00:01:46:20 --> 00:01:48:03
the man of
a thousand chicks.

46
00:01:48:05 --> 00:01:50:15
That's right. You think
I've been with a lot of broads.

47
00:01:50:16 --> 00:01:52:19
My dad's had more pie
than Kirstie Alley.

48
00:01:52:20 --> 00:01:54:14
(laughing) What?!

49
00:01:54:16 --> 00:01:56:04
Anyway, the navy
is honoring him

50
00:01:56:06 --> 00:01:57:08
at this year's
naval ball

51
00:01:57:09 --> 00:01:59:02
for all his bravery
in Vietnam.

52
00:01:59:04 --> 00:02:01:03
Wow, you must be proud.

53
00:02:01:05 --> 00:02:04:02
Sure am. He was like a hero
to me when I was growing up.

54
00:02:04:04 --> 00:02:05:14
You know who was my hero?

55
00:02:05:16 --> 00:02:09:01
Aquaman... and his secret
alter ego, Arthur Curry.

56
00:02:09:02 --> 00:02:11:09
Wow, you saved our lives,
Aquaman!

57
00:02:11:10 --> 00:02:13:06
Just doing my job.

58
00:02:15:03 --> 00:02:16:06
Arthur Curry!

59
00:02:16:07 --> 00:02:17:07
Did you see Aquaman?

60
00:02:17:09 --> 00:02:18:14
He was just here!

61
00:02:18:15 --> 00:02:20:11
Oh, darn,
I must've missed him.

62
00:02:20:12 --> 00:02:22:08
We forgot
to tell him thanks.

63
00:02:22:10 --> 00:02:25:05
Oh, I have a feeling
he already knows.

64
00:02:30:06 --> 00:02:31:12
(doorbell rings)

65
00:02:33:05 --> 00:02:34:17
Hey, guys.
Come on in.

66
00:02:34:19 --> 00:02:36:15
Dad, they're here!

67
00:02:36:17 --> 00:02:38:18
At ease, ladies.

68
00:02:38:20 --> 00:02:41:07
Hey, Glenn, you're not gonna
give your dad an entrance?

69
00:02:41:09 --> 00:02:42:06
Oh, yeah, yeah,
I forgot.

70
00:02:42:07 --> 00:02:44:19
Guys, watch this.

71
00:02:44:21 --> 00:02:46:14
("These Boots Were Made
for Walking" plays)

72
00:02:46:15 --> 00:02:48:17
* Are you ready, boots? *

73
00:02:50:04 --> 00:02:51:08
* Start walking! *

74
00:02:59:00 --> 00:03:00:12
Ha! That's my dad!

75
00:03:00:13 --> 00:03:03:14
No one dances like Lieutenant
Commander Dan Quagmire.

76
00:03:03:16 --> 00:03:05:03
Dad, this is Joe and Peter.

77
00:03:05:04 --> 00:03:06:10
Joe and Peter!

78
00:03:06:12 --> 00:03:08:02
Which one are you?
Peter, sir.

79
00:03:08:04 --> 00:03:10:02
Look at you.
You're a chowhound,
aren't ya, Pete?

80
00:03:10:04 --> 00:03:12:06
Don't want to get behind you
in the mess hall, huh?

81
00:03:12:08 --> 00:03:14:00
No, sir.
No, you don't, sir.

82
00:03:14:01 --> 00:03:15:07
I'd stand and salute you, sir,

83
00:03:15:09 --> 00:03:17:07
but this is the best I can do.

84
00:03:18:09 --> 00:03:19:23
I'll take it.

85
00:03:20:01 --> 00:03:21:22
And a salutey-rooty-toot-tooty
back to you, my friend.

86
00:03:22:00 --> 00:03:23:17
Sir, you gotta tell
them about the time

87
00:03:23:18 --> 00:03:25:23
you had to eject
from your plane
behind enemy lines.

88
00:03:26:01 --> 00:03:28:10
And I will, but first,
it's been a long trip.

89
00:03:28:11 --> 00:03:29:19
This sailor needs a cosmo.

90
00:03:29:21 --> 00:03:31:13
A cosmo?

91
00:03:31:15 --> 00:03:33:16
Hey, it's got to be 5:00
somewhere, right? (laughs)

92
00:03:33:18 --> 00:03:35:14
(chuckles)

93
00:03:35:16 --> 00:03:37:08
Okay, fine.
I'll make you one;
you tell a story.

94
00:03:37:09 --> 00:03:39:01
He can be such
a nudge.

95
00:03:39:03 --> 00:03:41:03
So, anyhoo,
I remember that day
like it was yesterday.

96
00:03:41:05 --> 00:03:42:17
I'd gotten a haircut
earlier that day,

97
00:03:42:19 --> 00:03:45:04
the first one
I ever got over there
that looked like anything.

98
00:03:45:05 --> 00:03:46:22
So all of a sudden,
we get these orders.

99
00:03:47:00 --> 00:03:48:06
And, of course, it's
the day of all days

100
00:03:48:08 --> 00:03:50:02
I have to put on a helmet.

101
00:03:50:04 --> 00:03:52:15
I remember the sky was
a majestic orange.
(text alert tone)

102
00:03:52:17 --> 00:03:54:14
The breeze was just
warm enough that
you could wear

103
00:03:54:15 --> 00:03:56:14
short sleeves,
but you know, not so warm

104
00:03:56:15 --> 00:03:59:06
(text alert tone)
that you break any
kind of a sweat.

105
00:03:59:07 --> 00:04:01:02
because let me tell you,
I do hate to perspire.

106
00:04:01:03 --> 00:04:02:23
So anyway I just bit the bullet
and put on my helmet...

107
00:04:03:00 --> 00:04:05:07
Oh, sorry, that's
my auto spell correct.

108
00:04:05:08 --> 00:04:07:10
But, uh, yeah,
he's super gay.

109
00:04:12:05 --> 00:04:13:15
Brian, it's so boring here.

110
00:04:13:16 --> 00:04:15:05
When are you coming back?

111
00:04:15:06 --> 00:04:16:17
I'll be back soon, Stewie.

112
00:04:16:19 --> 00:04:18:06
And I gotta tell you, though,
this seminar is great.

113
00:04:18:08 --> 00:04:19:19
I'm really learning a lot.

114
00:04:19:21 --> 00:04:21:14
I'll tell you all about it
when I get home, okay?

115
00:04:21:16 --> 00:04:23:14
I'll talk to you later.
Wait, wait, hang on, Brian!

116
00:04:23:15 --> 00:04:25:18
There was, um, something else
I wanted to tell you.

117
00:04:25:19 --> 00:04:27:10
What?

118
00:04:27:11 --> 00:04:30:08
Um, the mail came a little later
than usual today.

119
00:04:30:10 --> 00:04:31:15
Yeah, Stewie, I gotta go.

120
00:04:31:17 --> 00:04:33:09
Ooh, wait, hang on, hang on!

121
00:04:33:11 --> 00:04:37:02
Did I tell you about...
that over there?

122
00:04:37:03 --> 00:04:39:04
Stewie, I can't physically see
what you're pointing at.

123
00:04:39:05 --> 00:04:40:12
I'm getting off now. Bye.
(phone beeps off)

124
00:04:40:13 --> 00:04:42:01
Well, your loss, Brian.

125
00:04:42:03 --> 00:04:43:12
That thing over there
is pretty interesting.

126
00:04:43:14 --> 00:04:46:12
Huh? An alien
in a grass skirt

127
00:04:46:13 --> 00:04:47:20
juggling torches.

128
00:04:47:21 --> 00:04:49:14
Yeah.

129
00:04:49:16 --> 00:04:52:09
All right, you're
all done. Go.

130
00:04:53:14 --> 00:04:55:05
Come on, Stewie.
Time for bed.

131
00:04:55:07 --> 00:04:57:08
Oh, get a job!

132
00:04:57:10 --> 00:04:58:14
Peter, what are
you doing home?

133
00:04:58:16 --> 00:05:00:10
I thought you'd be
out on the town

134
00:05:00:11 --> 00:05:01:16
with Quagmire
and his dad.

135
00:05:01:18 --> 00:05:03:06
Lois, you're not gonna
believe this.

136
00:05:03:08 --> 00:05:05:11
Quagmire's dad's gay.

137
00:05:05:13 --> 00:05:07:13
What? Quagmire never said
anything about that.

138
00:05:07:15 --> 00:05:09:01
I don't think he knows.

139
00:05:09:03 --> 00:05:10:15
It's like he doesn't
even notice it.

140
00:05:10:17 --> 00:05:12:13
Really? Well, then how
do you know he's gay?

141
00:05:12:15 --> 00:05:13:18
And a lot of
little things:

142
00:05:13:20 --> 00:05:15:12
the way he talks,
his mannerisms,

143
00:05:15:14 --> 00:05:18:06
and he had the complete
DVD set of Sex and the City

144
00:05:18:08 --> 00:05:19:07
between his butt cheeks.

145
00:05:19:08 --> 00:05:20:06
Peter, no, he didn't!

146
00:05:20:08 --> 00:05:21:15
No. He had
the DVD set.

147
00:05:21:17 --> 00:05:24:01
I was just being colorful
with the rest of it.

148
00:05:24:03 --> 00:05:26:09
Well, maybe you should go
talk to Glenn about it.

149
00:05:26:10 --> 00:05:28:07
I mean, especially
if he has no idea.

150
00:05:28:09 --> 00:05:30:02
I guess I could,
but I don't know

151
00:05:30:03 --> 00:05:32:10
if it'll do any good, Lois;
he's in complete denial,

152
00:05:32:11 --> 00:05:34:03
like people
in massive debt.

153
00:05:34:05 --> 00:05:36:11
Well, honey,
I've extended
our line of credit

154
00:05:36:13 --> 00:05:38:09
and exhausted
all our savings.

155
00:05:38:11 --> 00:05:40:05
We should be good
for another month.

156
00:05:40:07 --> 00:05:41:07
Oh, that's great,
honey.

157
00:05:41:08 --> 00:05:42:19
What are we gonna do
next month?

158
00:05:42:21 --> 00:05:45:01
Well, I'll tell you
what we're not gonna do:

159
00:05:45:03 --> 00:05:47:04
shoot all of our children
and then kill ourselves.

160
00:05:47:05 --> 00:05:49:17
(both laugh)
I'm gonna hold you
to that.

161
00:05:49:19 --> 00:05:52:01
I don't think you'll have
any control over it.

162
00:05:54:05 --> 00:05:55:13
(doorbell rings)

163
00:05:56:19 --> 00:05:58:15
Hey, Peter,
how you doing?

164
00:05:58:17 --> 00:06:00:19
Hey, Quagmire.
Um, is your dad around?

165
00:06:00:21 --> 00:06:03:08
Oh, he's off at his
stitch n' bitch club.

166
00:06:03:10 --> 00:06:04:20
I'm glad you stopped by, though,

167
00:06:04:22 --> 00:06:07:02
My dad wanted me to tell you
he would be thrilled

168
00:06:07:04 --> 00:06:09:21
if you and Lois would join us
as his guests at the naval ball.

169
00:06:09:22 --> 00:06:11:15
Yeah, yeah, that'd be great.

170
00:06:11:16 --> 00:06:14:08
Um... hey, remember when
we met him the other day,

171
00:06:14:10 --> 00:06:15:23
and he danced for a while?

172
00:06:16:01 --> 00:06:17:16
Oh, yeah, that was
so funny, man!

173
00:06:17:18 --> 00:06:19:11
No, it, it
wasn't funny.
Oh, my God.

174
00:06:19:12 --> 00:06:20:20
He's hilarious,
that guy.

175
00:06:20:22 --> 00:06:22:18
It wasn't funny.
It wasn't funny.
It was gay.

176
00:06:22:20 --> 00:06:24:11
(laughs)

177
00:06:24:12 --> 00:06:25:18
What?

178
00:06:25:20 --> 00:06:27:21
Yeah, I think
that your father is gay.

179
00:06:27:23 --> 00:06:29:13
Gay?! (laughs)

180
00:06:29:15 --> 00:06:30:20
We-we should
all be so gay!

181
00:06:30:21 --> 00:06:32:17
Quagmire,
don't you see it?

182
00:06:32:19 --> 00:06:34:11
See what?
I'll tell you
what I'm seeing.

183
00:06:34:13 --> 00:06:36:01
You're jealous!
Huh?

184
00:06:36:02 --> 00:06:38:02
Yeah, your father's a drunk,
and mine's a hero.

185
00:06:38:03 --> 00:06:39:19
Look, you'll see.

186
00:06:39:21 --> 00:06:42:14
At the navy ball, you'll see
how much of a man he is

187
00:06:42:15 --> 00:06:44:03
and how everyone in the military
respects him.

188
00:06:48:10 --> 00:06:50:21
(lively conversations,
music playing)

189
00:06:54:00 --> 00:06:55:14
Look at this, Dad.

190
00:06:55:16 --> 00:06:57:03
All of these people came out
just to honor you.

191
00:06:57:04 --> 00:06:59:12
Oh, it feels good, son;
I won't lie to you.

192
00:06:59:13 --> 00:07:00:12
Dan Quagmire!

193
00:07:00:14 --> 00:07:02:08
Wally!
Good to see you.

194
00:07:02:09 --> 00:07:03:09
This my son Glenn.

195
00:07:03:11 --> 00:07:04:21
Nice to meet
you, Glenn.

196
00:07:04:22 --> 00:07:06:11
You should be
very proud of
your dad.

197
00:07:06:13 --> 00:07:07:17
Oh, I am, sir.

198
00:07:07:19 --> 00:07:09:00
It was an honor
to serve with him.

199
00:07:09:01 --> 00:07:10:18
Come on, Dan,
let's get a drink.

200
00:07:10:20 --> 00:07:12:04
Huh. It's great
to see you

201
00:07:12:06 --> 00:07:13:15
back in your
element tonight;

202
00:07:13:17 --> 00:07:14:22
surrounded by seamen.

203
00:07:15:00 --> 00:07:16:10
(chuckles) "Seamen."

204
00:07:16:11 --> 00:07:17:15
See, Quagmire?
I told you he's gay.

205
00:07:17:17 --> 00:07:19:00
Shut up, Peter!

206
00:07:19:02 --> 00:07:21:00
Hey, you Dan's boy?
That's right.

207
00:07:21:02 --> 00:07:23:03
Your dad was very brave
back in Southeast Asia.

208
00:07:23:04 --> 00:07:24:15
He flew supplies in

209
00:07:24:16 --> 00:07:25:19
where others wouldn't
dare to go.

210
00:07:25:21 --> 00:07:27:16
I can't tell you
how many loads

211
00:07:27:17 --> 00:07:30:00
you dad took when
I served with him.
Huh?

212
00:07:30:01 --> 00:07:31:23
Glenn, I wouldn't miss
this night for the world.

213
00:07:32:00 --> 00:07:33:17
Everyone here
admires your dad.

214
00:07:33:19 --> 00:07:35:12
He'd walk into
an army barracks

215
00:07:35:13 --> 00:07:37:12
and make every private there
feel important.

216
00:07:37:13 --> 00:07:39:19
Yeah, he just knew how
to stroke those privates.

217
00:07:39:21 --> 00:07:41:01
Oh, God!

218
00:07:41:02 --> 00:07:42:21
Your dad was cock
of the walk, Glenn.

219
00:07:42:23 --> 00:07:45:02
Every day at rifle training,
he'd help me clean my butt.

220
00:07:45:03 --> 00:07:47:02
Your dad once drank
me under the table.

221
00:07:47:03 --> 00:07:50:01
If there was one man
you wanted in your hole,
it was your dad.

222
00:07:50:02 --> 00:07:51:19
Your dad had
the best penis
in the military.

223
00:07:51:21 --> 00:07:53:11
Okay, just stop, stop!

224
00:07:53:13 --> 00:07:54:23
Everybody stop!

225
00:07:55:00 --> 00:07:56:15
Dad...

226
00:07:56:17 --> 00:07:58:23
are you gay?

227
00:07:59:01 --> 00:08:00:05
What?

228
00:08:00:07 --> 00:08:01:14
Are you gay, Dad?!

229
00:08:01:16 --> 00:08:03:12
No, Glenn, I'm not gay.

230
00:08:03:13 --> 00:08:04:20
Just, just tell me the truth!

231
00:08:04:22 --> 00:08:06:07
I am telling you the truth.

232
00:08:06:08 --> 00:08:07:16
Now calm down.
You're ruining this ball.

233
00:08:07:18 --> 00:08:09:09
You know how much I love balls.

234
00:08:09:10 --> 00:08:11:01
All right, come on now!
That's not helping!

235
00:08:11:02 --> 00:08:14:16
Son, you have my word,
I am not gay.

236
00:08:14:17 --> 00:08:16:21
You promise?

237
00:08:16:22 --> 00:08:18:08
I promise.

238
00:08:18:10 --> 00:08:20:19
All right, I believe you.

239
00:08:20:21 --> 00:08:23:04
But I am a woman trapped
in a man's body.

240
00:08:23:06 --> 00:08:24:15
And while I'm in Quahog,

241
00:08:24:16 --> 00:08:27:04
I plan to have
a sex-change operation.

242
00:08:27:06 --> 00:08:29:04
Oh, come on.

243
00:08:29:06 --> 00:08:30:14
Just be gay.

244
00:08:33:09 --> 00:08:34:22
(knocking)

245
00:08:35:00 --> 00:08:36:18
Hey, guys,
you got a minute?

246
00:08:36:20 --> 00:08:38:05
Hey,
what's up, buddy?

247
00:08:38:07 --> 00:08:40:16
It's, um,
it's about my dad.

248
00:08:40:18 --> 00:08:43:15
He... he wants to have
a sex-change operation

249
00:08:43:17 --> 00:08:45:10
Whoa! I knew he was gay.

250
00:08:45:12 --> 00:08:47:00
I didn't think
he was that gay.

251
00:08:47:01 --> 00:08:48:17
No, no, Peter,
he's not gay.

252
00:08:48:18 --> 00:08:50:03
He's a woman stuck
in a man's body.

253
00:08:50:05 --> 00:08:51:05
Yeah, gay.

254
00:08:51:06 --> 00:08:52:04
It's totally different!

255
00:08:52:06 --> 00:08:53:05
Sounds the same.

256
00:08:53:06 --> 00:08:54:08
Well, it's not!

257
00:08:54:10 --> 00:08:55:18
Okay, so he wants
to be a woman

258
00:08:55:19 --> 00:08:56:21
so he can
be a lesbian?

259
00:08:56:22 --> 00:08:58:04
No, he'd date men.

260
00:08:58:06 --> 00:09:00:00
Gay.
Gay.
Yeah, gay.

261
00:09:00:02 --> 00:09:02:06
Okay, this is not
the help I came
over here for.

262
00:09:02:07 --> 00:09:04:13
Well, look, let's just all
agree that he's odd, huh?

263
00:09:04:15 --> 00:09:05:22
(laughs)

264
00:09:05:23 --> 00:09:07:23
He has an appointment Friday
with Dr. Hartman

265
00:09:08:00 --> 00:09:10:18
to have the procedure,
and he wants me to go with him.

266
00:09:10:20 --> 00:09:12:20
I-I just, I don't know
if I can handle that.

267
00:09:12:21 --> 00:09:15:01
Well, I'm sure your friend
Peter would be happy

268
00:09:15:03 --> 00:09:16:21
to come along
for moral support.

269
00:09:16:22 --> 00:09:18:17
All right, but look,
here's the deal:

270
00:09:18:19 --> 00:09:21:00
Anything he lops off,
we get to bring home for Brian.

271
00:09:21:01 --> 00:09:22:13
That's very green
of you, Peter.

272
00:09:22:15 --> 00:09:23:21
What?
I don't know.

273
00:09:23:22 --> 00:09:25:18
Lois, that doesn't make
any sense at all.

274
00:09:25:19 --> 00:09:27:02
Yeah, it's something
I heard on TV.

275
00:09:27:04 --> 00:09:29:01
I don't know.
Have fun at the circus.

276
00:09:33:19 --> 00:09:36:06
(sighs) I wonder how long
it's gonna take.

277
00:09:36:07 --> 00:09:37:17
I don't know.

278
00:09:37:19 --> 00:09:39:10
Hey, hey, you know
what we should do?

279
00:09:39:11 --> 00:09:40:23
We should put on
some '80s music,

280
00:09:41:00 --> 00:09:42:08
and then, like,
every few minutes,

281
00:09:42:09 --> 00:09:43:20
have him come
out of there

282
00:09:43:22 --> 00:09:46:00
as a different sex,
and we'll go...

283
00:09:46:02 --> 00:09:47:23
And then like the fifth
or sixth sex,

284
00:09:48:01 --> 00:09:49:20
we'll go like this...

285
00:09:49:21 --> 00:09:51:21
This is not a joke,
Peter, okay?!

286
00:09:51:23 --> 00:09:53:17
They're cutting off
his penis in there!

287
00:09:53:19 --> 00:09:55:01
All right, all right.

288
00:09:55:03 --> 00:09:57:02
I mean, this is my dad
we're talking about!

289
00:09:57:03 --> 00:09:58:18
Okay, okay.

290
00:09:58:19 --> 00:10:00:17
What are you
gonna name it, huh?

291
00:10:00:18 --> 00:10:01:23
What are you
gonna name

292
00:10:02:01 --> 00:10:03:07
your he/she
father/mother?

293
00:10:03:09 --> 00:10:04:14
Knock it off!

294
00:10:04:16 --> 00:10:08:11
Wow! That thing was on there.

295
00:10:08:12 --> 00:10:10:11
How is he, Doc?
Is he all right?

296
00:10:10:12 --> 00:10:12:03
No, I'm afraid not.
(gasps)

297
00:10:12:05 --> 00:10:15:00
But she's gonna be just fine!

298
00:10:21:13 --> 00:10:23:16
Oh, my God!

299
00:10:23:17 --> 00:10:25:08
(feminine voice):
What do you think, boys!

300
00:10:25:09 --> 00:10:30:09
* I'm walking on
sunshine, whoa-oa! *

301
00:10:35:04 --> 00:10:38:22
Okay, kids, Mr. Quagmire
and his da-- h-his mo--

302
00:10:38:23 --> 00:10:40:22
his friend are coming
over soon for dinner.

303
00:10:40:23 --> 00:10:42:19
So, remember, Chris,
no staring.

304
00:10:42:20 --> 00:10:44:17
And, Meg, you know
how it is

305
00:10:44:19 --> 00:10:46:10
to be different,
so be very nice.

306
00:10:46:11 --> 00:10:47:20
(doorbell rings)

307
00:10:49:08 --> 00:10:50:19
Well, hi, you guys.

308
00:10:50:20 --> 00:10:53:04
I'm so glad you
could come over.

309
00:10:53:06 --> 00:10:56:10
Everyone, I'd like you
to meet Ida.

310
00:10:56:12 --> 00:10:58:00
Hello,
everyone.

311
00:10:58:01 --> 00:10:59:10
Hello, Ida.
What's up?

312
00:10:59:12 --> 00:11:00:22
I made a crumble.

313
00:11:01:00 --> 00:11:02:02
Oh, how thoughtful.

314
00:11:02:04 --> 00:11:05:21
Throw it away
in the outside garbage.

315
00:11:09:16 --> 00:11:11:23
Okay, you know what?
Elephant in the room.

316
00:11:12:01 --> 00:11:14:03
I'll say it. So, Ida,
you miss your penis?

317
00:11:14:04 --> 00:11:16:11
Peter!
Thank you for asking it.

318
00:11:16:13 --> 00:11:19:11
Geez.
No, it's okay, it's
a perfectly normal question.

319
00:11:19:12 --> 00:11:21:23
We can't sit here and just
pretend everything's the same.

320
00:11:22:00 --> 00:11:24:05
It is a big transition
for me, yes.

321
00:11:24:07 --> 00:11:26:08
But the answer is,
I still have it.

322
00:11:26:09 --> 00:11:28:12
They just turn it inside out
to simulate a vagina.

323
00:11:28:14 --> 00:11:29:21
Come on, Dad...

324
00:11:29:23 --> 00:11:31:17
Not a bad option
to have in the back pocket.

325
00:11:31:18 --> 00:11:33:19
So, Lois, w-what
is this meal?

326
00:11:33:21 --> 00:11:35:16
Wow... so good.

327
00:11:35:17 --> 00:11:36:20
Oh, thank you, Glenn.

328
00:11:36:22 --> 00:11:38:01
It's nothing fancy.

329
00:11:38:02 --> 00:11:39:20
Just chicken
with rosemary.

330
00:11:39:22 --> 00:11:41:23
But I did put a lot of
planning into the meal.

331
00:11:42:01 --> 00:11:43:04
Yeah, we went down the list.

332
00:11:43:06 --> 00:11:44:14
Nothing with wieners,
nuts, or grapes.

333
00:11:44:16 --> 00:11:46:00
Out of respect.

334
00:11:46:02 --> 00:11:48:05
Lois, I have to say,
you look so put together.

335
00:11:48:07 --> 00:11:49:15
Where do you buy
your clothes?

336
00:11:49:16 --> 00:11:51:06
Oh, how sweet.

337
00:11:51:07 --> 00:11:52:21
Well, I love Anne Klein.

338
00:11:52:23 --> 00:11:54:00
Oh, I'll have
to try them.

339
00:11:54:02 --> 00:11:55:20
I like the outfit
you have on.

340
00:11:55:21 --> 00:11:57:11
Thank you, Meg.
Who did your procedure?

341
00:11:57:12 --> 00:12:00:21
Wow, you just burned your
last friend in this room, lady.

342
00:12:00:23 --> 00:12:02:13
This corn is special.

343
00:12:02:15 --> 00:12:03:17
So tell me about
those knockers.

344
00:12:03:19 --> 00:12:04:22
Are we-- are tho--

345
00:12:05:00 --> 00:12:06:21
is that just like,
r-- implants

346
00:12:06:22 --> 00:12:09:01
or did they reassign
some ass fat up there?

347
00:12:09:03 --> 00:12:10:18
All right, I'm out of here.

348
00:12:10:19 --> 00:12:12:05
(door slams)

349
00:12:12:06 --> 00:12:15:01
I wonder if I could
push mine inside.

350
00:12:15:02 --> 00:12:17:22
Oh, my God, it worked.
It's gone.

351
00:12:17:23 --> 00:12:19:05
I can't believe--
oh, no, it's back.

352
00:12:27:05 --> 00:12:29:02
Well, that was quite
a performance.

353
00:12:29:04 --> 00:12:31:13
My performance?
What about you?

354
00:12:31:15 --> 00:12:33:00
"Golly, Lois,
where do you shop?

355
00:12:33:01 --> 00:12:34:03
"Gee, your house
looks beautiful.

356
00:12:34:04 --> 00:12:35:11
Hey, I have
an inside-out penis."

357
00:12:35:13 --> 00:12:37:02
I never said their
house looks beautiful.

358
00:12:37:04 --> 00:12:38:09
Because, frankly,
it didn't.

359
00:12:38:11 --> 00:12:41:14
My dad, my dad,
talking about decorating

360
00:12:41:16 --> 00:12:43:06
and women's clothing?

361
00:12:43:07 --> 00:12:45:15
All I've talked about for years
with these people

362
00:12:45:17 --> 00:12:47:06
is what a war hero you were.

363
00:12:47:08 --> 00:12:48:11
And I was.

364
00:12:48:13 --> 00:12:50:10
I'm changing my future,
not my past.

365
00:12:50:11 --> 00:12:53:08
Oh, yeah?
What about my future, huh?

366
00:12:53:10 --> 00:12:55:01
I don't even know
what to call you.

367
00:12:55:03 --> 00:12:57:07
My dad? My other mother?

368
00:12:57:09 --> 00:13:00:01
My friend who pees sitting down
but can also palm a basketball?

369
00:13:00:03 --> 00:13:02:04
What about Ida?
Oh, no.

370
00:13:02:06 --> 00:13:05:00
Man, you know,
this is too hard.

371
00:13:05:01 --> 00:13:07:04
You know, you're asking me
to accept an awful lot.

372
00:13:07:06 --> 00:13:10:00
I... I... I don't know
if I can do this.

373
00:13:10:01 --> 00:13:11:23
I understand.

374
00:13:12:01 --> 00:13:14:09
I had the advantage of thinking
about this for years.

375
00:13:14:10 --> 00:13:16:22
For me it was easy:
do I want to be happy

376
00:13:17:00 --> 00:13:18:09
the rest of my life
or miserable?

377
00:13:18:10 --> 00:13:20:10
So now you're happy
and I'm miserable.

378
00:13:20:12 --> 00:13:22:06
I see.

379
00:13:22:08 --> 00:13:24:07
I'm sorry you feel that way.

380
00:13:32:20 --> 00:13:34:23
Oh, boy, nice
to be back home.

381
00:13:35:00 --> 00:13:37:00
Those seminars
can wear you out.

382
00:13:37:02 --> 00:13:39:20
(clears throat)

383
00:13:39:21 --> 00:13:41:16
Wow, did you say
"Web-based Internet series"?

384
00:13:41:17 --> 00:13:44:21
No.
Oh, my bad.

385
00:13:44:23 --> 00:13:46:23
Great... idea...
for one.

386
00:13:47:01 --> 00:13:48:05
Where am I taking
you again?

387
00:13:48:06 --> 00:13:50:01
You know what?
Drop me off at the Marriott.

388
00:13:50:02 --> 00:13:51:13
I could use a drink.

389
00:13:54:23 --> 00:13:57:01
Jack on the
rocks, please.

390
00:13:58:20 --> 00:14:02:22
Hey, here's to exciting new
opportunities on the Internet.

391
00:14:06:07 --> 00:14:08:02
I'm sorry, I didn't
mean to bother you.

392
00:14:08:04 --> 00:14:09:15
Oh, no, it's not you.

393
00:14:09:16 --> 00:14:11:16
I-I'm just dealing
with a lot right now.

394
00:14:11:17 --> 00:14:13:00
You know, kids.

395
00:14:13:02 --> 00:14:16:09
Ah. Does not... come...
with a manual.

396
00:14:16:10 --> 00:14:18:01
(chuckles)

397
00:14:18:03 --> 00:14:19:06
So, wha-- you're doing
something with the Internet?

398
00:14:19:08 --> 00:14:20:19
I am, I am.

399
00:14:20:21 --> 00:14:23:03
Being a writer, I'm always
exploring new possibilities.

400
00:14:23:05 --> 00:14:24:18
Wow, I could
never be a writer.

401
00:14:24:20 --> 00:14:26:06
How do you do it?

402
00:14:26:08 --> 00:14:28:09
Well, you see,
when I watch the world go by,

403
00:14:28:10 --> 00:14:30:18
I think of it kind of
like a huge screen.

404
00:14:30:19 --> 00:14:33:01
You know, every little
interaction, every little moment

405
00:14:33:03 --> 00:14:35:23
is another scene captured
by this camera.

406
00:14:36:00 --> 00:14:37:15
That's fascinating.

407
00:14:37:17 --> 00:14:38:19
Oh, yeah.

408
00:14:38:21 --> 00:14:40:19
Brian.
Ida.

409
00:14:40:20 --> 00:14:43:01
Two more, please.

410
00:14:43:03 --> 00:14:45:04
So I finally tell them,

411
00:14:45:05 --> 00:14:48:16
"Hey, I came here to be
at the seminar, not run it."

412
00:14:48:17 --> 00:14:50:14
(both laughing)

413
00:14:52:03 --> 00:14:53:17
That's... oh.
(chuckles)

414
00:14:53:18 --> 00:14:55:02
Hmm.

415
00:15:01:06 --> 00:15:03:23
You know,
we are in a hotel.

416
00:15:04:01 --> 00:15:06:17
And I'm in room 406.

417
00:15:06:19 --> 00:15:08:22
Go on ahead,
I'll settle up.

418
00:15:11:11 --> 00:15:13:15
Put it on 406.

419
00:15:18:04 --> 00:15:20:03
Well, look who's home.
Hey, buddy.

420
00:15:20:04 --> 00:15:21:18
How was the seminar?

421
00:15:21:20 --> 00:15:23:22
Oh, it was terrific.
The first day we were there...

422
00:15:24:00 --> 00:15:26:21
Brian, Brian, Brian.
I was after good or bad.

423
00:15:26:22 --> 00:15:28:01
You know what?
Fine.

424
00:15:28:03 --> 00:15:29:16
Y-You guys are not gonna
get to me this morning.

425
00:15:29:17 --> 00:15:31:03
I am in too good a mood.

426
00:15:31:05 --> 00:15:34:03
I met an amazing woman;
finally, the whole package.

427
00:15:34:05 --> 00:15:35:20
Oh, you met her
at the seminar?

428
00:15:35:22 --> 00:15:38:15
No, that's just it-- it was
right here in town last night.

429
00:15:38:16 --> 00:15:41:03
She's a classy,
smart, beautiful lady.

430
00:15:41:04 --> 00:15:42:19
Look, I took a
picture of her.

431
00:15:42:20 --> 00:15:44:03
See.

432
00:15:48:22 --> 00:15:50:01
Uh...

433
00:15:50:03 --> 00:15:54:01
Wha... i-i-is...?

434
00:15:54:02 --> 00:15:55:11
Um...

435
00:15:55:13 --> 00:15:56:19
Uh...

436
00:15:56:21 --> 00:15:59:00
Here, Lois, take a look.

437
00:15:59:01 --> 00:16:02:04
(both laughing uncontrollably)

438
00:16:03:09 --> 00:16:04:23
Oh, my God!

439
00:16:05:01 --> 00:16:07:16
This is the best
day of my life!

440
00:16:07:18 --> 00:16:09:06
(laughing)

441
00:16:09:08 --> 00:16:10:08
You know what?
You're just jealous

442
00:16:10:10 --> 00:16:12:12
'cause I found a real woman.

443
00:16:12:14 --> 00:16:15:11
(laughing harder)

444
00:16:17:05 --> 00:16:18:18
Oh, hey, Brian.

445
00:16:18:19 --> 00:16:20:00
Hey.

446
00:16:20:02 --> 00:16:22:00
Not to worry,
I called in,

447
00:16:22:02 --> 00:16:24:17
and a new cell phone
should be here for you
in three business days.

448
00:16:24:19 --> 00:16:26:13
What? Why?
Well, clearly,
yours is broken.

449
00:16:26:15 --> 00:16:28:01
Because I haven't
heard from you.

450
00:16:28:02 --> 00:16:29:17
I wanted to tell
you about my week.

451
00:16:29:18 --> 00:16:31:08
God... doesn't anyone
in this house

452
00:16:31:09 --> 00:16:33:01
care about anyone
but themselves?

453
00:16:33:03 --> 00:16:34:09
Hey, Brian,
how was the seminar?

454
00:16:34:10 --> 00:16:35:13
Meg, please.

455
00:16:35:14 --> 00:16:37:03
I'm serious, Stewie.

456
00:16:37:05 --> 00:16:39:12
I have had an amazing
few days and nobody cares.

457
00:16:39:14 --> 00:16:41:04
Oh, come on in.
Come on in.

458
00:16:41:06 --> 00:16:42:20
Tell old Stew.

459
00:16:42:22 --> 00:16:45:02
Okay, well, first, the
seminar was terrific.

460
00:16:45:03 --> 00:16:46:15
I absorbed so much.

461
00:16:46:16 --> 00:16:48:10
And then I get back here
last night,

462
00:16:48:11 --> 00:16:50:08
and I meet an incredible woman.

463
00:16:50:10 --> 00:16:52:11
You know, I've heard the phrase
soul mate for years,

464
00:16:52:12 --> 00:16:54:14
and I never got it
till last night.

465
00:16:54:16 --> 00:16:58:07
Well, I've got a woman
story for you that you're
not gonna believe.

466
00:16:58:08 --> 00:17:01:04
Quagmire's father,
decorated war hero,

467
00:17:01:05 --> 00:17:05:02
Lieutenant Commander
Dan Quagmire, is now a woman.

468
00:17:05:04 --> 00:17:06:06
You're kidding.

469
00:17:06:08 --> 00:17:08:09
No. Total sex change.

470
00:17:08:10 --> 00:17:10:09
(laughs)
That is hysterical.
I know, huh?

471
00:17:10:10 --> 00:17:12:13
Suck on that, Quagmire.

472
00:17:12:14 --> 00:17:16:05
Yeah, it's, it's not settling
with the Q-man all too well.

473
00:17:16:06 --> 00:17:18:00
Oh, my God, what--
wha-what does it look like?

474
00:17:18:02 --> 00:17:19:07
You know, not half bad.

475
00:17:19:09 --> 00:17:21:06
Nothing you'd look
twice at, but not bad.

476
00:17:21:07 --> 00:17:23:12
Oh, my God, that-- you know,
that is a tough road ahead.

477
00:17:23:14 --> 00:17:25:08
I mean, like,
what do those people do

478
00:17:25:10 --> 00:17:27:21
as far as relationships
and sex and stuff?

479
00:17:27:23 --> 00:17:29:13
I don't know.

480
00:17:29:15 --> 00:17:31:23
I mean, it's got to be
a train wreck down there, right?

481
00:17:32:00 --> 00:17:33:23
I mean, just-just an absolute
casserole of nonsense.

482
00:17:34:00 --> 00:17:36:12
Is she over there right now?
We should go take a look.

483
00:17:36:13 --> 00:17:38:05
No. They had a fight;
she's staying at the Marriott.

484
00:17:38:06 --> 00:17:39:18
Aw, damn, I was just there.
Really?

485
00:17:39:20 --> 00:17:42:07
Yeah, maybe I saw him in the
lobby and didn't even know.

486
00:17:42:09 --> 00:17:44:06
Oh, no, you'd know.

487
00:17:44:07 --> 00:17:45:21
Aw, man, what-what
do we call him now?

488
00:17:45:22 --> 00:17:47:09
We-- do we still
call him Dan?

489
00:17:47:10 --> 00:17:49:06
No, and I'm not crazy
about the name change.

490
00:17:49:07 --> 00:17:50:14
What is it...
like Danielle or Dana?

491
00:17:50:16 --> 00:17:51:20
No, Ida.

492
00:17:53:20 --> 00:17:55:10
(retching)

493
00:18:00:04 --> 00:18:03:04
(retching)

494
00:18:34:03 --> 00:18:37:00
(gasping)

495
00:18:37:02 --> 00:18:38:14
(screaming)

496
00:18:38:16 --> 00:18:41:02
Oh, what?! What the hell?!
What's wrong with you?!

497
00:18:41:04 --> 00:18:42:17
I had sex with her!
What?!

498
00:18:42:18 --> 00:18:44:16
I had sex with her
at the Marriott!

499
00:18:44:17 --> 00:18:46:00
Aah, why?!

500
00:18:46:01 --> 00:18:47:21
I didn't know!
I didn't know it was her!

501
00:18:47:22 --> 00:18:51:09
Oh, my God!
(both screaming)

502
00:18:51:10 --> 00:18:53:11
How does this happen?!
When they move to a new place,

503
00:18:53:13 --> 00:18:54:12
they're supposed to notify
the neighborhood!

504
00:18:54:14 --> 00:18:56:08
That's how it works!

505
00:18:56:10 --> 00:18:58:09
He didn't actually move,
he's just visiting!

506
00:19:08:22 --> 00:19:11:06
Oh, Dad, I've been worried sick.
Where have you been?

507
00:19:11:08 --> 00:19:15:16
Listen, I... I feel awful about
the things I said last night.

508
00:19:15:17 --> 00:19:17:09
I was selfish.

509
00:19:17:11 --> 00:19:19:01
Aw, you weren't selfish.

510
00:19:19:02 --> 00:19:21:06
I realize I put
a lot on you.

511
00:19:21:08 --> 00:19:22:17
I was wrong
to just assume

512
00:19:22:19 --> 00:19:25:08
that you would understand
and be able to accept this.

513
00:19:25:10 --> 00:19:29:12
But, trust me, I had been
unhappy for a long, long time.

514
00:19:29:14 --> 00:19:31:15
Wow.

515
00:19:31:17 --> 00:19:33:19
Well, all I want is
for you to be happy.

516
00:19:33:21 --> 00:19:35:14
You're my dad.

517
00:19:35:15 --> 00:19:37:23
And if you're happy,
I'm happy for you.

518
00:19:38:01 --> 00:19:39:15
I'm sorry, Dad.

519
00:19:39:17 --> 00:19:40:19
I love you.

520
00:19:40:21 --> 00:19:42:16
I love you, too, Glenn.

521
00:19:44:15 --> 00:19:45:20
Glenn?

522
00:19:45:21 --> 00:19:47:02
Sorry, sorry.

523
00:19:47:04 --> 00:19:48:16
Damn thing can't
tell the difference.

524
00:19:48:18 --> 00:19:50:17
(both laughing)

525
00:19:50:19 --> 00:19:52:10
Oh, dear...

526
00:19:52:12 --> 00:19:55:05
Okay, well, so now that we got
all the mush out of the way,

527
00:19:55:07 --> 00:19:56:17
I have some news.

528
00:19:56:19 --> 00:19:57:21
Tell me. Tell me.

529
00:19:57:22 --> 00:19:59:06
I met someone.

530
00:19:59:07 --> 00:20:00:11
What? You did?

531
00:20:00:13 --> 00:20:02:00
Oh, my God, Glenn,
he's amazing.

532
00:20:02:02 --> 00:20:03:07
I couldn't be happier.

533
00:20:03:09 --> 00:20:04:11
Really? What's his name?

534
00:20:05:16 --> 00:20:08:07
QUAGMIRE (screaming):
No!

535
00:20:08:09 --> 00:20:10:13
(shuddering)

536
00:20:16:22 --> 00:20:19:08
(shuddering continues)

537
00:20:22:07 --> 00:20:23:12
(door slams)

538
00:20:23:13 --> 00:20:25:11
QUAGMIRE:
Where is he?!

539
00:20:25:13 --> 00:20:27:20
Where is that self-centered,
arrogant son of a bitch?!

540
00:20:30:20 --> 00:20:32:18
Get out of there,
you dirty little bastard!

541
00:20:32:20 --> 00:20:34:06
You're dead!

542
00:20:34:08 --> 00:20:37:07
(both grunting)

543
00:20:40:23 --> 00:20:42:17
(groans)

544
00:20:45:06 --> 00:20:48:07
(both grunting)

545
00:20:48:08 --> 00:20:49:17
(groaning)

546
00:20:54:05 --> 00:20:56:02
If I ever see you
anywhere near my house,

547
00:20:56:04 --> 00:20:57:12
I'll blow your head off!

548
00:20:58:21 --> 00:21:01:00
Now lay there and die,
you piece of crap!

549
00:21:04:13 --> 00:21:05:21
(panting):
Hey.

550
00:21:07:04 --> 00:21:09:23
I (bleep) your dad.
